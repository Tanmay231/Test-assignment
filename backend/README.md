# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates my skils. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node


# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/TestNFT.js --network sepolia

# Verify contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/verify.js --network sepolia
```
